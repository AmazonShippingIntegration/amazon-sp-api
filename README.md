Repository for Amazon shipping SP API for Swagger and Pre-built code
## Amazon Shipping API Repository
This repository contains Swagger models for developers to use to create software to call Amazon Shipping APIs. Developers can use [swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) to generate client libraries from these models. Please refer to [selling-partner-api-docs](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs) for additional documentation and read the [Amazon Shipping API Developer Guide](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/amazon-shipping/) for instructions to get started.

The [models directory](https://github.com/AmazonShippingIntegration/amazon-sp-api/blob/main/swagger/v2/amz_model.json) contains Amazon Shipping V2 API models.

The [Pre-built code directory](https://github.com/AmazonShippingIntegration/amazon-sp-api/tree/main/Pre-built-code) contains a [PHP library](https://github.com/AmazonShippingIntegration/amazon-sp-api/tree/main/Pre-built-code/PHP) and a [C# library](https://github.com/AmazonShippingIntegration/amazon-sp-api/tree/main/Pre-built-code/C%23) and [VB.NET Library] (https://github.com/AmazonShippingIntegration/amazon-sp-api/tree/main/Pre-built-code/VB.Net). These libraries can be used to integrate with Amazon shipping V2 APIs.
